<h2>Context</h2>

<p> Fourth project developed for Driven Software Engineer bootcamp, you can check it out by this <a href="https://gabao55.github.io/parrots-card-game/">link</a>. The first module of the course was an introduction to Interfaces and Front-end Aplications, so we explored pages interaction through JavaScript, so to consolidate knowledge the project task was to create a memory card game.
